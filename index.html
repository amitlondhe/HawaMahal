<h2>Inspiration</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Weather and time of the day play very important role in deciding which form of the music a user would listen to. Indian classical music has different "ragas" for different times of the day. </p></li>
<li><p>There are some "ragas" which are related to "weather" conditions as well. As an example, according to legend, raga Malhar is so powerful that when sung, it can induce rainfall. ( Referred from Wikipedia).
In general human emotions very according to the weather and hence the song selection too. </p></li>
<li><p>"Hawa" in Hindi means "Wind" and "Mahal" stands for palace. Since this app uses "weather conditions" as a primary function for selecting songs, named it HawaMahal. There also used to be a Bollywood classic songs program named "HawaMahal" on "All India Radio" in past (Not sure if it is still going on) </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>What it does</h2>

<ul>
<li>HawaMahal uses Spark and Scala to process historical weather data and songs played by users in the vicinity of user's location to come up with the song recommendations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How I built it</h2>

<ul>
<li>Retrieved the historical weather data for year 2015 and moved it to Swift Object storage.</li>
<li>Got hold of few random bollywood songs from Spotify and used their developer APIs to fetch the information that I was interested in.</li>
<li>Generated and uploaded the dataset that mapped those songs to each day of the year 2015. This is absolutely random but proves the idea.</li>
<li>By joining these two datasets figured out the relationship between weather conditions ( Temperature for now) and songs played.</li>
<li>Android app that figures out user's location and weather condition in real-time, uses this data to talk to Swift Object storage to retrieve the recommendations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>

<ul>
<li>I was hoping to get anonymous data about daywise list of Songs played in particular region. As I did not find anything like it, I had to cook my own dataset.</li>
<li>Scala Notebooks that I had created at the start of hackathon was not working and it took a little time and IBM's assistance to figure out the issues.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>

<ul>
<li>Completion of another project from conceptualization to implementation.</li>
<li>Felt creative while preparing the Android App logo for this app. I have also animated the musical notes in logo which gets displayed while app fetches the song details.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What I learned</h2>

<ul>
<li>Substantial Spark and Scala learning opportunity </li>
<li>Android APIs </li>
<li>Spotify Developer APIs</li>
</ul>
